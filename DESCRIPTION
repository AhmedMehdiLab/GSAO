Authors@R:
    c(person("Lilin", "Yang", role = c("aut", "cre"),
             email = "lilin.yang@uq.net.au"),

Description: A package containing a curated database and enrichment tool to
    calculate enriched gene set annotations. This package can also extract
    differentially-expressed genes from Seurat objects and visually display
    enriched pathways. The functions used in this package are based of those in
    the `glacier` package.
